\\\\What is the problem of stationarity?
\\Is the underlying problem itself stable
\\\\What is a superior investor?

  $P = \frac{D_1}{k - g} = \frac{E_1b}{k - g}$ \rightarrow $\frac{P}{E_1} = \frac{b}{k - g}$;
  using $D_1 = bE_1$
\item[How do you calculate P/E ratios for companies like Tesla with no earnings?]

  You get dividends for a stock. Management and Board of Directors decide dividends and Board of Directors are elected by stock holders.
  Bonds are contracts between company and bond holder (contract called indenture).
\item[Bonds]
  If you violate terms of the indenture (bond holders can issue default and you become legally bankrupt)
  $P = \frac{C_1}{1 + k} + \frac{C_2}{(1 + k)^2} + \dots + \frac{C_n + P}{(1 + k)^n}$;
  Solve for k = IRR;
  Promised YTM = 2 x k;
  US government's promised YTM is basically guaranteed because they can print dollars
\item[What is a debt rating?]
  rating for a particular bond (AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, D) - SP and Moody's;

  massive scandal and entire Brazilian government was brought down
\item[What is the cost of equity?]
  $E(r) = r_f + B_a(E(r_m) - r_f)$
\item[Why can't you use the past average return?]
  non-stationarity and measurement error (small sample and very variable)
\item[Yogi Berell (Yankee player)]
  ``Cut pizza into 16th instead of 8th, I'm really hungry'';
  Can't make average more precise by dividing time series into finer increments (but measurement of variance or covariance can be improved)
\item[What is the risk free rate?]
  20 year treasury bond rate (2.68\%
\item[What is the beta?]
  covariance(return of stock, market return) / variance(market return)
\item[What does it mean if the beta is greater than 1?]
  there is luck and beta is greater than 1;
  Wall Street takes $\frac{2}{3} \hat B - \frac{1}{3} 1$ to discount the luck
\item[What's the two problems with the long run historical average?]
  selectivity (first smoke study on 65 year olds - smokers lived longer (many skinny women)) - US data, we haven't lost any wars;

  increase in mutual funds and retirement portfolios;
  collection and dispersion of data on the financial performance of equity investments;
  decline in the volatility of the return on the market portfolio;
  aging of US population that will sell equities to fund retirement
\item[What is a good approximation for the market return?]
  $P = \frac{Div}{k -g}$;
  $k - g = \frac{Div}{P}$;
  $k = \frac{Div}{p} + g$;
  currently dividend yield is 2\%, 4.5\% nominal growth;
  $k = 6.5\%$ which is the expected return, which is approximately $4\%$ more than the risk free rate
\item[What is Google trying to do?]
  avoiding fake news
\item[What is WACC?]
  weighted average cost of capital = cost of equity * weight of equity + cost of debt * (1 - tax rate) * weight of debt;
  $WACC = k_e*w_e + k_d (1 + t) w_d$;
\item[What are the two ways to do DCF?]
  WACC way and adjusted present value;
  FCF discounted at WACC;
  APV, adjusted present value: FCF discounted at all equity cost of capital + value of tax shields
\item[What is the assymetry between debt interest payments and stock dividend payments?]
  can deduct debt interest before calculating taxes but dividend payments are not deductible;
  can reduce tax bill by issuing bonds (deductibility of interest)
\item[Verizon]
  acquired Sensity, Fleetmatics, XO, Volicon, AOL, Yahoo!;
  recent projects - unlimited, Corning, Verizon LTE advanced;
  adjusted present value - advantage over DCF if capital structure changes over time;
  free cash flow (net income + depreciation - change in working capital) is before dividends are calculated
\item[How do you go from enterprise value to stock value?]
  enterprise value - debt + cash = equity value
\end{description}

  Events study - Financials/Estimates(10k or other filings), Analyst Reports (HSBC, UBS) - buy side and sell side (mostly sell side),
  Credit Rating Reports(Moody's, Fitch, S\&P), other news;

  WACC - discount rate reflects tax shield;
  APV - discount rate is all equity cost of equity, you discount tax shields seperately and add;
  APV has advantage over regular DCF if capital structure changes over time;
  APV is useful in leveraged buyouts because the bought company usually holds substantial debt, company repays debts using unleveraged cash flow, allows tax deductions on interest payments;
  APV - calculate PV as if company finances a project or investment using equity alone;
  Adjust PV for financing benefits: APV = NPV - ;
  use market value of equity (not book value) or else unlevered beta is too low, Verizon has debt-equity ratio of 0.58;
  PV of tax shield; \$100 of debt, 5\% interest, can deduce \$5 of interest, tax saving is \$2 if tax rate is 40\%; debt times rate times tax rate divided by (1 + k) to get present value

  so it can keep cash and incentivize employees
\item[What is the CAPM?]

  relationship between risk and expected returns
\item[What is the three factor model?]
  similar as above with $\beta_p, \beta_{SMB, P}, \beta_{HML, P}$
\item[What is easier to estimate: individual or industry beta?]
  industry beta because standard deviation is lower
\subsection{CAPM and Fama-French model}

  FF has slightly lower error but both were very inaccurate in 2001;
  gold and coal industries were the least accurate in early 2000s
\item[What is adjusted beta?]
  one third of market beta plus one third of estimated beta
\item[What is the unlevered cost of equity?]
  cost of equity if there is no debt
\item[Why does leverage affect a companies beta and how?]
  interest cost is fixed number so if there is the same return, the leveraged return multiplies;
  leverage magnifies percentage change;
  $B_L = B_U (1 + D/E)$
\item[Are houses worse investments than houses?]
  no because usually highly levered assets are very stable

  Acquirer becomes A + (S - P)
  AT\&T wants to acquire Time Warner
\item[What are synergies (good reasons)?]
  cut costs (executive offices, sales forces);
  competition (violating anti-trust laws) - merger creates wealth for companies at expense of consumer (Standard Oil of New Jersey, later known as Exxon);
  combination of talents (Microsoft tried to merge with Intuit but government blocked it);
  Vertical integration;
  Economics of scale (more efficient by putting businesses together);
  bad management (in the middle) (Armen Hammer got into his 90s - stock price would go up when he didn't show up for a while because they were hoping he was dead)

  bad management (in the middle) (Armen Hammer got into his 90s - stock price would go up when he didn't show up for a while because they were hoping he was dead)
  hubris or power (bigger enterprise to run = more prestige and power for executive even if there is no synergy);

  MCS was sold again to Seagram's after the chairman of the French water utility was arrested in France;
  e.g. Compass Lexicon working on competition aspect and making a lot of money on AT\&T and Time Warner deal, can cut costs but concern about competition;
  Time Warner and Charter Communications attempted to make a deal, Comcast trying to acquire Charter

\item[How do you estimate the large block discount?]
  Method 1 - estimate present value of cash flows;
  Method 2 - price pressure (impact on stock price when large block depresses market) and market exposure (cost associated with bearing the risk of holding stock while trying to sell it);
  Method 3 - sellers use a protective put option (no risk exposure, discount based on option premium)
\item[What did Harrah family do?]
  they went to Goldman Sachs which says it will give \$16 a share;
  IRS agreed to \$19 appraisal
