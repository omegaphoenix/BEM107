\\\\What is the problem of stationarity?
\\Is the underlying problem itself stable
\\\\What is a superior investor?

  $P = \frac{D_1}{k - g} = \frac{E_1b}{k - g}$ \rightarrow $\frac{P}{E_1} = \frac{b}{k - g}$;
  using $D_1 = bE_1$
\item[How do you calculate P/E ratios for companies like Tesla with no earnings?]

\section{Lecture 4 - 4/27/2017}
\item[Stocks vs Bonds]
  You get dividends for a stock. Management and Board of Directors decide dividends and Board of Directors are elected by stock holders.
  Bonds are contracts between company and bond holder (contract called indenture).
\item[Bonds]
  If you violate terms of the indenture (bond holders can issue default and you become legally bankrupt)
  $P = \frac{C_1}{1 + k} + \frac{C_2}{(1 + k)^2} + \dots + \frac{C_n + P}{(1 + k)^n}$;
  Solve for k = IRR;
  Promised YTM = 2 x k;
  US government's promised YTM is basically guaranteed because they can print dollars
\item[What is a debt rating?]
  rating for a particular bond (AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, D) - SP and Moody's;

  massive scandal and entire Brazilian government was brought down
\item[What is the cost of equity?]
  $E(r) = r_f + B_a(E(r_m) - r_f)$
\item[Why can't you use the past average return?]
  non-stationarity and measurement error (small sample and very variable)
\item[Yogi Berell (Yankee player)]
  ``Cut pizza into 16th instead of 8th, I'm really hungry'';
  Can't make average more precise by dividing time series into finer increments (but measurement of variance or covariance can be improved)
\item[What is the risk free rate?]
  20 year treasury bond rate (2.68\%
\item[What is the beta?]
  covariance(return of stock, market return) / variance(market return)
\item[What does it mean if the beta is greater than 1?]
  there is luck and beta is greater than 1;
  Wall Street takes $\frac{2}{3} \hat B - \frac{1}{3} 1$ to discount the luck
\item[What's the two problems with the long run historical average?]
  selectivity (first smoke study on 65 year olds - smokers lived longer (many skinny women)) - US data, we haven't lost any wars;

  innovations in capital market regulation and oversight to protect investors;
  advances in economic theory and policy leading to increased stabilization of the economy;
  advances in asset pricing and portfolio theory;
  increase in mutual funds and retirement portfolios;
  collection and dispersion of data on the financial performance of equity investments;
  decline in the volatility of the return on the market portfolio;
  aging of US population that will sell equities to fund retirement
\item[What is a good approximation for the market return?]
  $P = \frac{Div}{k -g}$;
  $k - g = \frac{Div}{P}$;
  $k = \frac{Div}{p} + g$;
  currently dividend yield is 2\%, 4.5\% nominal growth;
  $k = 6.5\%$ which is the expected return, which is approximately $4\%$ more than the risk free rate
\item[What is Google trying to do?]
  avoiding fake news
\item[What is WACC?]
  weighted average cost of capital = cost of equity * weight of equity + cost of debt * (1 - tax rate) * weight of debt;
  $WACC = k_e*w_e + k_d (1 + t) w_d$;
\item[What are the two ways to do DCF?]
  WACC way and adjusted present value;
  FCF discounted at WACC;
  APV, adjusted present value: FCF discounted at all equity cost of capital + value of tax shields
\item[What is the assymetry between debt interest payments and stock dividend payments?]
  can deduct debt interest before calculating taxes but dividend payments are not deductible;
  can reduce tax bill by issuing bonds (deductibility of interest)
\item[Verizon]
  acquired Sensity, Fleetmatics, XO, Volicon, AOL, Yahoo!;
  recent projects - unlimited, Corning, Verizon LTE advanced;
  adjusted present value - advantage over DCF if capital structure changes over time;
  free cash flow (net income + depreciation - change in working capital) is before dividends are calculated
\item[How do you go from enterprise value to stock value?]
  enterprise value - debt + cash = equity value
\end{description}

  both just buy index funds
\item[What does Compass Lexecon do?]
  Valuation, M\&A, Securities Fraud, Insider Trading, Damages Analyses (antitrust, securities, intellectual property, employment discrimination, breach of contract);
  Valuation - you didn't sell it for the best price (value acquired company's shares);

  Stock Performance - Yahoo finance, Google finance are good sources;
  Stock Price and Volume - Bloomberg, S\&P Capital IQ, CRSP, Yahoo Finance and Google Finance;
  Events study - Financials/Estimates(10k or other filings), Analyst Reports (HSBC, UBS) - buy side and sell side (mostly sell side),
  Credit Rating Reports(Moody's, Fitch, S\&P), other news;
  biased because management of companies are optimistic especially for sell side (because they want you to buy);
